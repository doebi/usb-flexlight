# USB Flexlight

Based on a flexible USB ventilator i created a USB flashlight for dark nights and other occasions.

## Idea

You know those nasty USB-Ventilators, which come with some LEDs on them to light the air they blow into your face? I found a way to turn them into useful flashlights for the darkest of nights. Just tear off all the ventilator parts, print the adapter, solder some LED on it and light your way. Might come in handy at the upcoming [CCC Camp](https://events.ccc.de/camp/2015/). When attached to a portable powerbank for your smartphone it'll make a great addition to your tent-furniture.
